🚗 Vehicle Management System in C++
This project demonstrates a C++ object-oriented design for managing different types of vehicles using inheritance, polymorphism, virtual functions, and dynamic memory management.

📁 Classes Implemented
Vehicle (Base Class)
Contains common vehicle attributes such as ID and mileage. Provides a virtual method to display details.

FuelBasedVehicle (Abstract Class)
Inherits from Vehicle and serves as a base class for fuel-dependent vehicles like Truck and Car.

Truck
Inherits from FuelBasedVehicle. Includes a loadCapacity attribute and overrides displayDetails() with validation.

Car
Inherits from FuelBasedVehicle. Adds passengerCapacity and custom validation.

ElectricCar
Inherits from Car. Adds batteryCapacity and overrides displayDetails() for full reporting.

🔍 Features
Polymorphism using base class pointers (Vehicle*)

Dynamic Memory Allocation and cleanup using delete

Vehicle Search Functionality based on vehicleID

Input Validation for negative values and empty strings

Extensible Design for future vehicle types

🧪 Example Usage
In main():

A Truck, Car, and ElectricCar are created dynamically.

Their information is printed using polymorphic calls to displayDetails().

Vehicles are cleaned up using delete to prevent memory leaks.
